# 📝 Blog Web Application

A clean and modern **blog web application** built to learn and apply real-world backend development concepts using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **JWT authentication**.

This project focuses on understanding how a backend works behind the scenes — from handling user authentication and protected routes to performing CRUD operations on blog posts. It’s designed as a hands-on learning project where simplicity meets practical implementation.
